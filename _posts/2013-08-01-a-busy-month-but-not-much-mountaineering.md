This past month has been very varied with several exciting projects on the go.First on the list was converting the van from a standard builders van to our home for adventures! Massive thank you to my buddy Karl for his help and patience!![Step 1 - insulation](/photos/blogger-posts/van1.jpg)![Carpeting the wheel arches](/photos/blogger-posts/van8.jpg)![Second layer of insulation on the walls and ply floor layed](/photos/blogger-posts/van4.jpg)![Vinyl floor in, ply sides on and the beginnings of a kitchen...](/photos/blogger-posts/van5.jpg)![Karl working hard on the bed](/photos/blogger-posts/van6.jpg)![We hit a few snags trying to create the bed but it came together in the end!](/photos/blogger-posts/van7.jpg)![The finished kitchen area](/photos/blogger-posts/van2.jpg)![Our home!](/photos/blogger-posts/van3.jpg)The next task was to build a log cabin/shed in my parents garden...![A photo](/photos/blogger-posts/shed1.jpg)![A photo](/photos/blogger-posts/shed4.jpg)![A photo](/photos/blogger-posts/shed2.jpg)We then had a week in the North West of Scotland "test driving" the van. Mairi's mum had been heavily involved in building a community skiff on the Isle of Seil and June saw the first world championships come to Ullapool. We had a row with the Seil team and watched them compete in a few races before heading off for a bit of climbing at Ardmair and then Beinn Eighe followed by a visit to Mairi's Uncle Jeremy and Grandparents in Gairloch.![The start line before one of the races (the Seil team is the second boat in)](/photos/blogger-posts/skiffworlds.jpg)![Isle of Seil sprint finish to book a place in the final of the over 50s race](/photos/blogger-posts/seil.jpg)![Stunning view from Ardmair crag](/photos/blogger-posts/ardmairview.jpg)![Mairi at the top of Central Buttress on Beinn Eighe](/photos/blogger-posts/topbeineighe.jpg)![Plenty of wild swimming!](/photos/blogger-posts/swim.jpg)![A quick dip in the river Etive](/photos/blogger-posts/etiveswim.jpg)A bit of sailing on Loch Lomond...![Sailing](/photos/blogger-posts/sailing.jpg)We're just back from a family holiday to Spain. We had a really relaxing week in the sun, with a bit of kayaking, lots of snorkelling and I tried diving for the first time (bad news, hooked on another sport!) We had hoped to do some climbing while on the Costa Blanca but the cliffs of Moraira are home to some rare species of plant so climbing is almost completely banned!![Stunning scenery on the Costa Blanca](/photos/blogger-posts/kayak2.jpg)![A photo](/photos/blogger-posts/kayak.jpg)This week is being taken up with the fun task of packing lots of kit for both our trip to the alps and our next stint in Antarctica as we will drop our possessions off at BAS headquarters in Cambridge on our way South to Dover.I'll try to update the blog a bit during our month in the alps but will hopefully be too busy climbing and mountain biking!
