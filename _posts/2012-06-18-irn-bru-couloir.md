After an eventful night last night involving all but 1 of our generators packing in leaving the base in complete darkness and causing an electrical fault which triggered the fire alarm which then developed into a full scale fire drill, and after only 5 hours of sleep (I was lucky to get that much, I think the Rob;the generator mechanic and others were up working into the small hours of the morning)...I got up and took Tom Stroud out for a climb. We chose to do a route called "Irn-Bru Couloir".The route followed the most obvious gully on repeater buttress, cutting directly up the centre. We moved together easily up the first section to the start of the difficulties before doing two long pitches and a further section of moving together to reach the top.Another stunning day in Antarctica!
