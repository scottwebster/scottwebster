In 2015, Scott and girlfriend Mairi are undertaking an overland mountaineering adventure.

The expedition will start in Scotland and will take Scott and Mairi through 15 different countries before arriving in Kyrgyzstan where they will fly into the Inylchek Glacier to attempt Khan Tengri (7010m), widely considered to be one of the most beautiful mountains in the world! After this the journey will continue through Kazakhstan and Russia to Mongolia where Scott and Mairi plan to explore the Altai Mountains, right on the border between Russia, China, Kazakhstan and Mongolia.

The Altaiâ€™s are similar in stature to the European Alps but very remote and largely unexplored. The final leg of the journey will take the team through Northern Kazakhstan and Siberian Russia back to Europe. The journey will take 20 weeks and cover a total distance of 20,000 miles, taking in 25 different countries.
