Place your orders on what you want me to sew for you while I'm away! <br /><br />I'm currently on a 3 day telehandler course in Cambridge. Playing in this machine is like being at an arcade for big kids...picking up pallets etc. - although the novelty wears off pretty quickly...<br /><br />Anyway back home on Thursday night then it's packing time!
