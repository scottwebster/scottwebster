Nice day out with Steve climbing a mixed route called Mairi's Chimney. The tricky climbing at the bottom of the chimney was really good but the easier ground near the top was very lose! There were a few scary moments as large boulders headed directly for Steve's head - thankfully nothing hit him!![Steve Stout](/photos/blogger-posts/1a.jpg)![Pitch one of a nice mixed chimney](/photos/blogger-posts/3a.jpg)![Moving together over some lose terrain](/photos/blogger-posts/4a.jpg)![Packing up at the top](/photos/blogger-posts/2a.jpg)
