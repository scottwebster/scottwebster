A couple of people have now asked me if I have a blog; suggesting that there are at least two people who may read what I put on here now and again!<br /><br />A bit of background about who I am and what I do... my name is Scott and I am a freelance mountaineering instructor, based in Scotland. I have been playing in the mountains since I was 4 years old when my Dad first taught me to ski. I soon began hill walking, scrambling, rock climbing and winter climbing. My passion quickly developed into a bit of an obsession and while studying at university I made the decision to pursue a career in the outdoors. Since starting on the UK instructor ladder I have completed the Summer Mountain Leader, Single Pitch Award, Winter Mountain Leader and Mountain Instructor Award. I have worked for a variety of organisations including Adventure Aberdeen, No Limits Development and Skye Guides. I also work with private clients on a bespoke basis.<br /><br />I will try to post about my trips into the mountains in the UK and abroad. On the 24th of October I am leaving the UK for Antarctica, where I will be based for the next 16 months or so. While in Antarctica I will be working for the British Antarctic Survey as a Field Assistant. Essentially I am employed as a mountaineer and my job is to guide scientists safely around the continent to various locations that they need to visit in order to carry out their research.<br /><br />Hopefully you will find some of my posts vaguely interesting and I promise to keep the words to a minimum and put up some exciting photographs!
