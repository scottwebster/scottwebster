After my trip to the Mars Oasis I was dropped off at Fossil Bluff, also on the King George VI sound, Alexander Island. Fossil Bluff is a BAS deep field fuel depot. The site was first established as a deep field base by BAS in 1961. The area was reached by traveling overland in large vehicles with caterpillar tracks. The men on the expedition carried with them supplies to build a hut, this hut is still there and is where I was staying. The hut is great and has a lot of character! It is exactly as an Antarctic base should be!<br /><br />During my time at Fossil Bluff sledge "Foxtrot" who had been drilling ice cores on the Larsen ice shelf this season were moving camp to the Ronnie ice shelf. This move took several plane trips to complete and kept us busy re-fueling the aircraft as they passed through the bluff.<br /><br />I was at Fossil Bluff for 10 days including Christmas Day. I was at "The Bluff" with Rob Lambert, our wintering Doctor at Rothera. For Christmas dinner we cooked up a lovely feast...<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-t7Exhs-A7bI/TxdGS8lmeNI/AAAAAAAAALE/389DCA1D7cM/s1600/DSC00903.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-t7Exhs-A7bI/TxdGS8lmeNI/AAAAAAAAALE/389DCA1D7cM/s320/DSC00903.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Bluebell Cottage at Fossil Bluff</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C-nDlNVrd1M/TxeEaCxyzSI/AAAAAAAAALM/NYg0v1I_A4k/s1600/DSC00947.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C-nDlNVrd1M/TxeEaCxyzSI/AAAAAAAAALM/NYg0v1I_A4k/s320/DSC00947.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Carving the Christmas Turkey...</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rfBvRQ52yqI/TxgCh23aBHI/AAAAAAAAALU/7kvTsVjqUTk/s1600/DSC01041.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rfBvRQ52yqI/TxgCh23aBHI/AAAAAAAAALU/7kvTsVjqUTk/s320/DSC01041.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Busy at the Fossil Bluff fuel station</td></tr></tbody></table>
