I've been out teaching some new arrivals Antarctic camp-craft and mountaineering skills for the past two days. Day one consisted of basic introductions to the kit that we use out here in the field with BAS...from the primus stoves and tily-lamps to the radios, sleeping systems and tents. We then spent the night out putting it all into practice, and today three of the team from yesterday came out with me for some more advanced mountaineering instruction.Today we looked at use of the ice axe and crampons, we also covered snow anchors, roped glacier travel and crevasse rescue from start to finish with an unconscious casualty.At the end of the day we returned to the base via reptile ridge which is a fantastic Alpine like ridge traverse around PD in grade.Time for a hot shower and some dinner!![Rob testing his buried axe belay](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC00544.jpg)
