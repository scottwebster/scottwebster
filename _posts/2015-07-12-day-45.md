Kyrgyzstan has got to be the easiest country in Central Asia to visit as it is visa-free for most nationalities.  Crossing the border was a hassle free process and by far the cheapest!

We will be in Kyrgyzstan for over a month, predominantly in the Tien Shan mountains as we attempt to climb Khan Tengri.  Our friend Malcolm is meeting us in the North of Kyrgyzstan in a weeks time and for now we have stopped in Osh (with it's legendary Baazar) to stock up on supplies.
