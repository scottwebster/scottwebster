The weather has been incredible on the Antarctic Peninsula for the last two days; blue skies, sunshine and hardly any wind - perfect! Yesterday Mairi, Tim and myself went back to the gully on the West of reptile ridge for a quick hit ski descent and I spent the morning today traversing the Southern section of reptile with Tom. It's amazing how much of a difference a little sunshine makes to morale and the overall atmosphere on base!![Shadow skiers!](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC03888.JPG)![A photo](/photos/blogger-posts/IMG_6056.jpg)![Mairi and Tim on Reptile](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC03892.JPG)![Dynafit catalogue shot](/photos/blogger-posts/IMG_6051.JPG)![Great day for a stroll!](/photos/blogger-posts/IMG_4111.JPG)![Tom looking heroic!](/photos/blogger-posts/IMG_4117.JPG)![Ok so I lied...there were a few clouds today...](/photos/blogger-posts/IMG_9280_2.JPG)
