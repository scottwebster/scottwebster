I've just been offered; and accepted, another spell of work in Antarctica. Still to discuss exact dates but it's looking like I'll go South again in January 2014. It's always hard to be away from friends and family for such a long period...but look at that view!![Leonie, Liotard and Gaudrey as seen from Reptile Ridge, Adelaide Island, Antarctica](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC00578_2.JPG)
