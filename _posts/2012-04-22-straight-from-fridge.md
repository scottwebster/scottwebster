The forecast for today was very poor and we were expecting strong winds and lots of snow...there were very strong winds but apart from that it was a lovely day. I took Rosey and Tim climbing on N. Stork today, we did a great route called "Straight from the Fridge" (IV,4) up the centre of N. Stork, finishing at the summit.

Not much else to write but a few photos of the day.
