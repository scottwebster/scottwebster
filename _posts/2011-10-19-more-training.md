I flew down to London on Sunday night and spent Monday on a sewing course...which was really good! Place your orders on what you want me to sew for you while I'm away!I'm currently on a 3 day telehandler course in Cambridge. Playing in this machine is like being at an arcade for big kids...picking up pallets etc. - although the novelty wears off pretty quickly...Anyway back home on Thursday night then it's packing time!
