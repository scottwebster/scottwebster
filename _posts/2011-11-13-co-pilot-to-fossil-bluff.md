Today I was lucky enough to be the co-pilot for a flight to Fossil Bluff. Fossil Bluff is a deep field refueling depot situated approximately 225 miles South of Rothera on the Antarctic Peninsula.I was flying with Al Howland, a very experienced polar pilot. Once we were in the air he handed me the controls...the visibility was nil so I spent the majority of the flight staring at the instruments which was very disorientating!![Twin Otter at Fossil Bluff](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC00460.JPG)
