After what seems like months of stormy weather we've finally had a decent spell of high pressure and I've been lucky enough to be able to make the most of it. It seems like ages since I've put anything on here so this is going to be a photo heavy update of some adventures I've had over the last couple of months.![Mount Bouvier](/photos/blogger-posts/bouvier.jpg)![Myself and Matt arriving at the summit of Bouvier](/photos/blogger-posts/bouvierwithmatt.jpg)![Above the clouds on the summit of Mt. Bouvier](/photos/blogger-posts/summitteam.jpg)![Forced to set up a temporary camp in order to wait for better weather to travel through a heavily crevassed area](/photos/blogger-posts/puptentspass.jpg)![Camp beneath the Stokes peaks with Mairi](/photos/blogger-posts/camp.jpg)![Beautiful weather in Picts](/photos/blogger-posts/Picts.jpg)![Abseiling to the base of our route for the day](/photos/blogger-posts/picts2.jpg)![Pitch 1](/photos/blogger-posts/picts3.jpg)![Pitch 2](/photos/blogger-posts/picts4.jpg)![Nearing the top of pitch 2](/photos/blogger-posts/picts5.jpg)![Mairi topping out of pitch 2](/photos/blogger-posts/picts6.jpg)![The easy snow ridge to the top of Picts](/photos/blogger-posts/picts7.jpg)![Another beautiful day. This crag hasn't been climbed on before so we thought we would explore it. We climbed the R to L diagonal gully on the right of the buttress to a crest and then through the mixed ground on the top right of the crag and then the skyline to the top](/photos/blogger-posts/newcrag.jpg)![Maz at the top, enjoying the sunshine!](/photos/blogger-posts/maz.jpg)![Top of the crag on the right as we descended back down to our skidoos](/photos/blogger-posts/newroutewalkoff.jpg)![Another stunning day. We climbed a nunatak called Orca, named as such because the summit tower looks like the dorsal fin of a killer whale](/photos/blogger-posts/OrcaEridge.jpg)![Views to the West across Ryder Bay from the top of Orca](/photos/blogger-posts/mazorcasummit.jpg)![Team selfie on the top of Orca](/photos/blogger-posts/orcaselfie.jpg)![Mairi abseiling off the summit tower](/photos/blogger-posts/mazorcaab.jpg)![Ministry of funny walks on the way back to the skidoos](/photos/blogger-posts/funnywalk.jpg)![A well earned rest back at the skidoos](/photos/blogger-posts/backatthecar.jpg)![Exploring a crevasse with some suspect lumps of ice on the roof](/photos/blogger-posts/crevasse2.jpg)![Mairi climbing back out of the crevasse](/photos/blogger-posts/crevasse.jpg)![Enjoying the sun late in the day](/photos/blogger-posts/enjoyingthesun.jpg)![We couldn't believe our luck as we got another day with not a cloud in the sky. This time we went for a ski tour up a couple of peaks.](/photos/blogger-posts/mazskitour.jpg)![Skinning up towards Gwendolyn's summit](/photos/blogger-posts/skitouring.jpg)![Walking the last section to the summit as the rime ice was horrible to ski on](/photos/blogger-posts/gwendolinesummit.jpg)![We ditched the skis and booted up the first top on the Mt. Mangin ridge](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC08903.jpg)
