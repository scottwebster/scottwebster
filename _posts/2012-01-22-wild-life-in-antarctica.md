Antarctica obviously has a very harsh environment for wildlife to survive in, however during the summer months there are lots of amazing animals around the coast.Since being in Antarctica I have been lucky enough to see several different species of seal, adelie penguins, skewars and arctic terns and killer wales. Here's a couple of snaps. The photo of the Killer Whale is too good to have been taken by me - thanks to Adam for that one!![Weddell seal pup](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC01084_2.jpg)![Killer Whale, Crabbie Seal and Skuar](/photos/blogger-posts/Orca+035.jpg)![Adelie Penguins](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC01147.JPG)
