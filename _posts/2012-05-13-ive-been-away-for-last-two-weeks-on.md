I've been away for the last two weeks on trips with Tim Jackson the first week and Tim Fox the second. Not much writing but a run down of Tim Jackson's trip in photos...We had a lovely evening ski tour after setting up camp on day 1.![Tim on our way up Trident](/photos/blogger-posts/TJ1.jpg)![Approaching the summit of Trident](/photos/blogger-posts/TJ4.jpg)![Trident Summit](/photos/blogger-posts/TJ2.jpg)![Tim putting in some nice turns on the way back to camp](/photos/blogger-posts/TJ3.jpg)Day 2 was spent hiding from the weather in our tent but day 3 was beautiful and we climbed a great gully nearby. We chose to carry our skis up the route so that we could make a quick descent back to the tent.![Tim enjoying "Spiritual Harmony"](/photos/blogger-posts/TJ6.jpg)![Good ice conditions](/photos/blogger-posts/TJ7.jpg)![Amazing snow mushrooms at the top](/photos/blogger-posts/TJ8.jpg)Day 4 wasn't the nicest but we got out for a couple of short climbs. First we did the trident ice-fall before climbing a short mixed route and finishing just as some very thick cloud settled in, making our short skidoo drive back to the tent quite exciting.![Top of our second route of the day](/photos/blogger-posts/TJ9.jpg)On the 5th day of the trip we went for another short ski tour before a spot of crevasse exploration.![Making the anchor](/photos/blogger-posts/TJ5.jpg)![Ominous lumps of ice above our heads](/photos/blogger-posts/TJ10.jpg)The weather forecast was looking bad for the remainder of the week so we made our way back to a hut that we have closer to base on Friday morning and did a good climb on North Stork to round off the week.![Awkward moves on soft snow](/photos/blogger-posts/TJ11.jpg)
