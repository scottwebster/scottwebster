Myself and Mark Mosgrove have just booked flights to Alaska for May 2013. &nbsp;Although still over 8 months away it is very exciting and feels like the trip is a reality now. &nbsp;We will be flying from Glasgow to Anchorage on the 21st of May and then traveling to Talkeetna - the gateway to the Denali NP. &nbsp;From Talkeetna it's a short flight in a single engine plane to base camp on the Kahiltna Glacier.<br /><br />Our plan is to&nbsp;acclimatise&nbsp;by climbing the West Buttress of Denali to the summit before getting on our main objective - the Cassin Ridge on the South Face of Denali.<br /><br />Denali (or Mt. Mckinley) is the highest peak in North America at 6194m. &nbsp;The Cassin route is a super classic and world renowned route first climbed in 1961 by a strong Italian team led by Ricardo Cassin. &nbsp;The route is possibly the most popular of the harder routes in this area of Alaska but it still doesn't see a huge number of ascents. &nbsp;By modern technical standards it isn't ridiculously hard;&nbsp;approx.&nbsp;scottish grade V with rock sections of up to 5.8 and a lot of easier ground&nbsp;in between,&nbsp;but it is a serious undertaking given the length (almost 2.5km of climbing), altitude and the nature of Alaska's arctic climate.<br /><br />Can't wait!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nOQbpNZHKaE/UCJlPuy7b_I/AAAAAAAAAj4/5HY3DSOT5-g/s1600/cassin.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="262" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nOQbpNZHKaE/UCJlPuy7b_I/AAAAAAAAAj4/5HY3DSOT5-g/s400/cassin.jpeg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Cassin ridge just left of centre</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><br />
