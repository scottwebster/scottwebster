Great news, both of our passports arrived back at the house today with the visas needed for our trip!  We also picked the car up from West Coast Off-road yesterday so we are pretty much ready to leave!  All that is left to do is visit the Russian Embassy in Edinburgh next week to have our fingerprints taken and we can set-off!

We'll try to put a post up tomorrow about the car with details of the modifications we have made for the trip.
