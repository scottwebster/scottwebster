I'm still catching up with myself after only being back in the UK a week today. It's been a busy week catching up with friends and family. On Friday my Dad and I headed to Cairngorm for a days skiing. The forecast wasn't the best I've ever seen but the snow conditions sounded great. We were very lucky and had sunshine most of the day and some of the best skiing conditions I've experienced in Scotland. We stopped in at Glemore Lodge on the way down the road so I could catch up with some friends and grab a bite to eat. Lots has changed since I worked at the Lodge including a completely re-furbished staff wing which is now customeraccommodation. It was however really nice to see some old and welcoming faces. I should also mention that our bar meal was incredible! We both had huge rib-eye steaks which were perfectly cooked for us.I'm off to Skye this weekend to do some work for Skye Guides. At the moment the plan is to do a 2 day traverse sometime between the 23rd and 26th but this will depend largely upon the weather and presence of snow on the ridge. At the end of the week I have a client who wants to climb "the highlander rock" (The Cioch) or the Inaccessible Pinn - both great days out. Looking forward to getting back out in the Cullin's and having more adventures!![A photo](/photos/blogger-posts/images.jpeg)![A photo](/photos/blogger-posts/SkyeRidge6-2011+(19).JPG)
