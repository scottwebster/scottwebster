Last night Rosey, Ash, Dale and myself went rock climbing on Mushroom buttress. &nbsp;We did a two pitch route called Biscoe Sour (VS, 4c). &nbsp;We left Rothera immediately after finishing work at 1800 and skidooed to within 500m of the base of the route. &nbsp;We then roped up and set off towards the rock. &nbsp;The snow was very soft and it was quite a challenge just to get to the climb. <br /><br />The weather had been stunning all day but the forecast was for strong winds and snow showers to develop at some point during the evening. &nbsp;We were climbing as a team of 4 which made for slow progress but it was very sociable which is always good! <br /><br />Pitch 1 goes up an easy corner/groove so a comfortable stance out of the wind. &nbsp;Pitch 2 then steps out onto the face before surmounting a bulge and&nbsp;continuing&nbsp;up another corner/groove system. &nbsp;Once at the top I rigged and anchor and we abseiled back to the foot of the climb where we had left our bags. &nbsp;By this point my feet were completely num with the cold and I was starting to get hot aches in my fingers!<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SC7iD77nDPM/TxYpyzjRrcI/AAAAAAAAAKw/Mu57vlIChfc/s1600/DSC01153.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SC7iD77nDPM/TxYpyzjRrcI/AAAAAAAAAKw/Mu57vlIChfc/s320/DSC01153.jpg" width="212" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Pitch 1</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W3cdxdSVzb4/TxYyu1kafHI/AAAAAAAAAK8/nfvfoLSj0S0/s1600/DSC01178.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W3cdxdSVzb4/TxYyu1kafHI/AAAAAAAAAK8/nfvfoLSj0S0/s320/DSC01178.jpg" width="241" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Pitch 2 (very cold hands at this point!)</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>
