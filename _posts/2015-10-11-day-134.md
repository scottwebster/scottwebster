Some of our friends from our last winter in Antarctica came to Amsterdam for a small reunion.  The weekend is a bit of a blur but was great fun and amazing to catch up with so many good friends.  Malcy even managed to make it despite having a flight to catch back down South today for another stint in Antarctica - I think he was only in Amsterdam for about 14 hours!
