So...I'm in Antarctica! I left the UK on Monday the 24th of October, first flying from Heathrow to Madrid, and then Madrid onto Santiago, then Santiago down to Punta Arenas and finally from Punta to Antarctica on the 26th.
Since arriving on base it has been pretty non stop with training and getting up to speed with the area and the kit down here. I haven't got much time to write much just now so you'll have to make do with a few photos!
