As we were traveling through Poland we felt that it was important to visit the Auschwitz concentration camp near Krakow.  As expected it wasn't a hugely enjoyable experience and despite being prepared for the horrors of the place we were both still blown away by the sheer scale of the atrocities carried out at this location.  A horrible chapter in history but one that we shouldn't forget.
