Mount Barre is one of three large peaks that make up the Princess Royal Range in Antarctica. &nbsp;Liotard, Gaudry and Barre dominate the horizon to the West of Rothera research station, towering above Ryder Bay. &nbsp;Although only a little over 2000m in height these peaks stretch down to sea level giving them a similar vertical relief to that of larger mountains elsewhere that start on high plateaus.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x1mYx29AdJw/VDFYB3eeOJI/AAAAAAAABv8/xHeCQdnVrhE/s1600/DSC_0500%2Bcopy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x1mYx29AdJw/VDFYB3eeOJI/AAAAAAAABv8/xHeCQdnVrhE/s1600/DSC_0500%2Bcopy.jpg" height="216" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The Princess Royal Range (Photo: Mairi Fenton)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Due to the fact that the range is only visited during the winter months when the weather is particularly fickle and the hours of daylight short these mountains see very few ascents. &nbsp;I was lucky enough to reach the summit of Mt. Liotard in 2012 with that years wintering Doctor, Rob Lambert. &nbsp;Since then Liotard has had no more ascents.<br /><br />Two weeks ago I got the opportunity to have a crack at Mt. Barre with Phil Stevens, another BAS field guide. &nbsp;At the end of all winter trips the field guides get a trip of our own, which is a great opportunity to try some of the slightly more committing objectives on Adelaide Island. &nbsp;Historically the end of September/start of October provides us with particularly poor weather and this year started off as no exception... Phil and I spent the first half of the week staring out of the window in frustration as heavy snow fell and 40 knot winds raced past. &nbsp;This weather system thankfully passed and we ski-doo'd to the Western side of Adelaide Island and set up camp beneath Barre.<br /><br />We woke early to find beautiful blue skies overhead and hardly a breath of wind - perfect conditions! &nbsp;We drove our skidoos 6km from camp to the base of Barre and clipped into our mountaineering skis. &nbsp;We made good time up the initial steepening (despite deep snow, and Phil's skins failing to stay stuck to his skis!) to gain the col between Barre and Mangin. &nbsp;At the col we were greeted by 20 knot winds which were unhelpfully picking up the soft snow that had fallen over the previous few days obscuring our vision. &nbsp;We persevered further up in the hope that the winds would calm down but sadly they just increased in strength. &nbsp;We reached the first of the difficulties and couldn't see enough to pick a good line through the bands of seracs so made the call to head back down to our camp. &nbsp;By this point the winds had picked up around camp too so we unpacked the kite for a few hours of fun!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;
