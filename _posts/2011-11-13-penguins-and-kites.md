A very quick post...had a great day today. Started with a ski tour in the morning over reptile ridge and then skiing down a grade 1 gully on the backside of skiway coll - 400m of amazing skiing towards the sea! (no photos of it unfortunately but I will go back up at some point this week to get some). After lunch I took one of the comms team down the local crevasse and then after dinner we did some kite flying. Also saw some penguins!![Adelie Penguin](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC00521.jpg)![Ian Hey flying his kite](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC00497_2.jpg)
