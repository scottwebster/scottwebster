Due to the delays crossing the Caspian Sea we thought we might have to miss out Bukhara in order to arrive in Kyrgyzstan in time for our helicopter transfers into the Tien Shan.  Thankfully with a couple of long days driving and some luck in getting visa extensions quicker than normal we managed a day in the amazing Silk Road city of Bukhara before moving on to Tajikistan.

Another common site, mixed herds of cows, donkeys and goats (the roads aren't usually this good however!).
