Since coming home from Antarctica I've been in touch with Australian mountaineer Damien Gildea. Damien is regarded as one of the main authorities on mountaineering in Antarctica and recently published an amazing book [Mountaineering in Antarctica](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mountaineering-Antarctica-Climbing-Frozen-South/dp/2875230069).Damien has just confirmed that one of the peaks Malcolm and I climbed in the Ellsworths last season was un-climbed and as such we have bagged the first ascent! The peak wasn't huge but was a beautiful looking mountain in an extremely beautiful and remote location. I'll never forget the climb but it definitely adds to it knowing that we were the first people ever to set foot on the summit and see those views. Details of our climb will be published in the American Alpine Journal.![Malcolm low down on the ascent, Minaret Peak behind](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC04863.jpg)![Malcolm on the lower section of our new peak with the stunning Minaret Peak behind - look out for this one in this years American Alpine Journal.](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC04869.jpg)![Perfect snow runnel linking the lower ridge to the upper](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC04889.jpg)![The summit behind Malcolm](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC04940.jpg)![Some of the technical climbing on crumbly limestone](/photos/blogger-posts/new.jpg)![Looking along the ridge to the summit](/photos/blogger-posts/Horseshoe+Sledge+India,+Malcs+camera+312.jpg)![Final snow slope to the summit](/photos/blogger-posts/Horseshoe+Sledge+India,+Malcs+camera+314.jpg)![The descent was as tricky as the ascent... lots of down climbing like this on loose rock!](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC04935.jpg)![Minaret on the right with our new peak on the left](/photos/blogger-posts/minareta.jpg)![Malcom and I on the summit after the successful first ascent!](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC04916.jpg)
