I felt the need to write another quick blog post and thought that it would be good to put up some inspirational photos.
One of the best things about climbing and mountaineering is that it takes you to some really amazing locations that otherwise you may not visit. So far my passion for climbing has taken me all over the UK. I have also been lucky enough to make several trips to the european alps, be part of an expedition to Greenland and climb in Norway.

Anyway here is a selection of photos from my various trips climbing...
