I have considered setting up a blog for a while now but to be honest I didn't think anyone would be interested in reading about what I am up to. A couple of people have now asked me if I have a blog; suggesting that there are at least two people who may read what I put on here now and again!

A bit of background about who I am and what I do... my name is Scott and I am a freelance mountaineering instructor, based in Scotland. I have been playing in the mountains since I was 4 years old when my Dad first taught me to ski. I soon began hill walking, scrambling, rock climbing and winter climbing. My passion quickly developed into a bit of an obsession and while studying at university I made the decision to pursue a career in the outdoors. Since starting on the UK instructor ladder I have completed the Summer Mountain Leader, Single Pitch Award, Winter Mountain Leader and Mountain Instructor Award. I have worked for a variety of organisations including Adventure Aberdeen, No Limits Development and Skye Guides. I also work with private clients on a bespoke basis.

I will try to post about my trips into the mountains in the UK and abroad. On the 24th of October I am leaving the UK for Antarctica, where I will be based for the next 16 months or so. While in Antarctica I will be working for the British Antarctic Survey as a Field Assistant. Essentially I am employed as a mountaineer and my job is to guide scientists safely around the continent to various locations that they need to visit in order to carry out their research.

Hopefully you will find some of my posts vaguely interesting and I promise to keep the words to a minimum and put up some exciting photographs!
