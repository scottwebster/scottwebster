Just a very quick post to show the view at Rothera today... Notice the big lenticular cloud, (the one that looks like a giant Spaceship!). The presence of these clouds indicates strong winds and is often a good indication of forthcoming weather in the mountains.The photos below are taken looking North/North East, towards the Stokes mountain range and the mountains on the Arrowsmith Peninsula.![A photo](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC02562.JPG)![A photo](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC02559.JPG)![A photo](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC02552.JPG)
