On Saturday's we have the afternoon off work, so yesterday after lunch I headed off base with Malcolm, Rob and Rosie in search of some sun-kissed granite! &nbsp;I was a bit sceptical as it was blowing about 35knots at the base but Malcolm; who has been down here doing the same job as me for the last year, assured me that we would find a crag out of the wind and in the sun...he was right! &nbsp;We went to a crag known as "Crag X" which lies on the North side of the Stork ridge. &nbsp;The crag had one recorded ascent on it but when we arrived there were several lines that looked possible. &nbsp;Malcolm lead a 50m arete that looked to have relatively stable rock the whole way up it and I did a 40m route up a corner to the left of the crag. &nbsp;It was a steep introduction to Antarctic rock climbing and to the seriousness of it all. &nbsp;The rock can be very loose in places and a lot of the gear is in hollow flakes and suspect blocks. <br /><br />The climbing was never overly hard but it was definitely exciting as most of the protection was of marginal quality and I was never quite sure how good the next hold was going to be. &nbsp;For these reasons it is very hard to assign a grade to it but it is somewhere in the region of HVS 4c/5a.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PIy9HlXVtCw/TskSIT48TUI/AAAAAAAAAJk/GQcSpF36cwc/s1600/DSC00592.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PIy9HlXVtCw/TskSIT48TUI/AAAAAAAAAJk/GQcSpF36cwc/s320/DSC00592.JPG" width="226" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The first ascent of Monopoly Groove - HVS, 4c*</td></tr></tbody></table>
