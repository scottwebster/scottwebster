It's been another busy summer down here and I haven't found the time to write any sort of blog post so this one is going to be a photo heavy round up of what I've been up to.

##### Mountaineering and Antarctic Travel Training #####

A large part of my job involves delivering training to BAS staff and visiting scientists. This training ranges from basic personal skills for operating on snowy ground, i.e. the use of crampons and an ice axe, through to more advanced techniques for glacier travel on foot and skidoo, and crevasse rescue systems.

##### Operating BAS' deep field base - Sky Blu #####

Another job that all BAS field assistants will undertake at some point during the summer season is running Sky Blu. Sky Blu is the hub for all deep field work BAS carries out on the continent and comprises of a blue ice run-way and large stocks of aviation fuel. Sky Blu is typically staffed by two vehicle mechanics whose job it is to operate and maintain the vehicles available to keep the blu ice runway free of snow, and one field assistant who manages the site and passes hourly weather observations to aircraft and back to Rothera.

##### Horseshoe Valley, Ellsworth Mountains #####

This was the second part of a project I led last season involving a study into the blue ice moraines. The project comprised of 4 Scientists, and two field guides - myself and Phil Stevens.

##### Depot work with the Chilean Navy #####

We often have visiting ships coming into Rothera during the summer season from various different nations operating down here. One visit this season was from the Chilean Naval vessel the Oscar Viel. While our Chilean friends were at Rothera they offered to help us re-stock some of our more remote emergency depots located on islands around Rothera using their on-board helicopter.
