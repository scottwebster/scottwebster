The first round of winter trips are over and it won't be long before the sun sets and we won't see it again for over 2 months. My final pre mid-winter trip was with Chris Walton, the Rothera wintering Chef. We had mixed weather including rain at a camp site located 600m above sea level! After a couple of good weather days we ended up getting pinned down by 50 knot winds for the remainder of the week so not many exciting photos!![Chris in Macallum's Pass with Stone House Bay behind](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC08260.jpg)![Our camp at the Myth as the winds begin to pick up...](/photos/blogger-posts/DSC08268.jpg)In the last week the weather has improved and temperatures have begun to drop closer to the sort of temperature you would expect in Antarctica during the winter. A band of high pressure has brought cold and calm conditions allowing the sea to begin to freeze over and some beautiful sun rises.The other day Mairi and I went for a climb near to Rothera known as "Irn-Bru Couloir". It was a stunning morning and we were definitely feeling quite smug when we returned to base just as some people were getting out of bed.![Sun-rise to the North East from the base of Irn-Bru Couloir](/photos/blogger-posts/IMG_7831.jpg)![The first main pitch of Irn-Bru](/photos/blogger-posts/IMG_7845.jpg)

I also took a group snow holing in the Stork hills near to Rothera. We had a very pleasant night with an equally pleasant bottle of Whisky and some mulled wine!
