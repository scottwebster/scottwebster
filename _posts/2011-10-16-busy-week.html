Last week I was on a fire fighter training course at Durham Tees Valley airport. &nbsp;The course lasted for three days and we covered a variety of tactics and techniques for controlling fires in buildings and on aircrafts. &nbsp;We also looked at search and rescue within the context of a burning building or plane. &nbsp;During the three days we practiced using breathing apparatus, water hoses, foam hoses and dry powder hoses. &nbsp;We completed several scenarios involving burning, smoke filled planes with dummies onboard. &nbsp;The course was really good and I definitely learnt a lot of new skills but I hope to never have to use them in a real situation.<br /><br />On Saturday I headed to Cummingston with Susie. &nbsp;As is often the case the weather in Aviemore was awful but an hours drive to the Moray coast saw us in sunshine! &nbsp;We didn't arrive at the crag until about half one and we had plans for the evening so we didn't get a massive amount of climbing done but what we did was good fun.<br /><br />I'm down south again at the moment, this time for an industrial sewing course and JCB/fork lift truck training. &nbsp;With only a week left in the UK before I head to Antarctica I seem to be rushing around all over the place! &nbsp;Busy busy!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mLhVp7nyHa4/TpslatKco6I/AAAAAAAAAEM/rOxiwlbVLww/s1600/DSC00235.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mLhVp7nyHa4/TpslatKco6I/AAAAAAAAAEM/rOxiwlbVLww/s320/DSC00235.jpg" width="212" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Susie on Centre - VS, 4b</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Y9bTsu0wc1Y/Tpsl3Ox0lrI/AAAAAAAAAEU/wFlS0hgMNVY/s1600/DSC00252.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Y9bTsu0wc1Y/Tpsl3Ox0lrI/AAAAAAAAAEU/wFlS0hgMNVY/s320/DSC00252.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Susie on the top of the Prophet walls area</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hs-yP9ewOeI/TpsmUcojgxI/AAAAAAAAAEc/d5MS6190jhg/s1600/DSC00259.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hs-yP9ewOeI/TpsmUcojgxI/AAAAAAAAAEc/d5MS6190jhg/s320/DSC00259.jpg" width="212" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Left - VS, 5a</td></tr></tbody></table>
