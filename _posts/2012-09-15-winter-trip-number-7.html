So that's me back at Rothera after leading my final winter trip of the season. &nbsp;The winter trips are basically an opportunity for all wintering staff to spend some time exploring Adelaide Island, travelling by skidoo, mountaineering, climbing, skiing and camping in Antarctica. &nbsp;Each member of the wintering team gets two week long trips and aside from being a fantastic opportunity for everyone the trips are also vital training for myself and the other "Field Assistants". &nbsp;Travel in Antarctica is very unique and you won't find a lot of the kit we rely on down here being used in many other places throughout the world so the trips allow us to perfect various techniques and familiarise ourselves with the kit before the summer season kicks off again.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

Steve and Tim, we shot off down the slopes towards our skidoos. &nbsp;We made a fast turnaround back to camp to take down our tent and load the sledges so that we could get back closer to base before the predicted poor weather returned Friday and Saturday. &nbsp;It really was a phenomenal day and so nice to be in the sun again after what seems like an age of storms.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;
