Our friend Sabrina who we worked in Antarctica with is from Germany and met us in Berlin to spend a couple of days with us and show us around.  During the return leg of our trip through Russia Mairi and I have been listening to some podcasts trying to learn more about the period following WWII and the Soviet era.  Arriving in Berlin and visiting the remains of the Berlin Wall was a great way to round off some of what we have learned and visit the physical division between East and West, Socialism and Capitalism.
