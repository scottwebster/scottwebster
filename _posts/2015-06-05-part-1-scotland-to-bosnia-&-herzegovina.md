We've reached the end of our first week on the road!  It's been a crazy but amazing week and it's hard to believe we still have another 18 weeks left!  We've packed a lot in to the last week and covered laods of ground.  Our route so far has taken us through England, France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Italy, Croatia and Bosnia & Herzegovina.
