Scott Webster is a professional moutaineering instructor with extensive Alpine and Antarctic experience.

He studied Marketing at University in Aberdeen before deciding to pursue a career in the outdoors, and has worked for Glenmore Lodge – Scotland's National Outdoor Centre.

In addition to freelance guiding, Scott has worked all over Scotland for a variety of organisations, including No Limits Development, Skye Guides and Adventure Aberdeen.

Further afield, Scott has overwintered twice in Antarctica, working for the British Antarctic Survey as a Field Guide.
