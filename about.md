Scott Webster Mountaineering offers professional mountaineering instruction and guiding in Scotland.  Courses are offered in all aspects of climbing and mountaineering, summer and winter.

Scott Webster Mountaineering is owned and run by me, Scott Webster.  I studied marketing at The Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, during which time I began working part time in the outdoor industry and gaining National Governing Body (NGB) awards in mountaineering.  

After graduating I began working full time as a mountaineering instructor.  I currently hold the Mountain Instructor Award (MIA) and Winter Mountain Leader (WML).  I am also working towards the Mountain Instructor Certificate (MIC - the highest qualification for mountaineering instruction in the UK).

In addition to working throughout the UK mountains I have spent a total of 3 years working in Antarctica for the British Antarctic Survey as a Field Guide.  During this time I have led scientific and logistics parties throughout the Antarctic Peninsula, Ellsworth Mountains, Ronne Ice-Shelf and Pine Island Glacier.

Personal expeditions have taken me to Greenland, Norway, The European Alps, Alaska, Kyrgyzstan, and Mongolia.

I am deeply passionate about mountaineering and the outdoors.   I enjoy sharing this passion with others and look forward to passing on some of my knowledge to you in the future!
